refactor: extract 4 views from RightPanel (Phase 1/2)

Phase 1 completion - extracted views:
- LibraryView.tsx (12 lines) - fallback view
- BusinessNotesView.tsx (120 lines) - Notes & Context display
- BusinessFollowupsView.tsx (141 lines) - Follow-ups list
- MeetingsView.tsx (732 lines) - Meetings with ideation panel

Created comprehensive plan for Phase 2:
- REFACTOR_PLAN_NEXT_SESSION.md (copy-paste instructions)
- REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.md (progress tracking)

Remaining for Phase 2:
- PeopleView.tsx (840 lines) - 3 tabs with org chart
- ConversationsView.tsx (760 lines) - AI strategy builder
- Update RightPanel to router pattern
- Remove Pipeline from LeftPanel

Progress:
- Original RightPanel: 3,420 lines (unchanged)
- Extracted so far: 1,005 lines into 4 view files
- Target: ~250 lines for main file (93% reduction)

All code preserved exactly - pure extraction refactor.
